We are team LabOrigin. Since we believe that the ORIGIN comes first, and that the underlying logic and essence are the foundation for determining how everything develops.

LabOrigin gathers talents from leading institutions, including Expedia, Electronic Arts , Standard Chartered, Webank, Pingan and Tencent Games. Our educational backgrounds of core members are from SAIC(School of the Art Institute of Chicago), Purdue University, MSU(Michigan State University), and UIUC(University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign). Most of us have over 10-year experience in software/blockchain development, sound engineering, game design, global cooperation/distribution, and community operations. Our team is currently based in Canada, and we are planning to open an office in Dubai in the near future.

We believe, rather than a purely financial paradigm, Web3 will return to a network built on and for trust among people and their souls.
We started to explore the possibility of SocialFi when we attended ETHGlobal HackMoney in 2021. We registered socialfi.io with the intention of building a decentralized credit lending protocol. This made us realize that social networking and collaboration are necessary for the reputation system of Web3, and it also has a huge value, so W3.work was born for that.

Our team has rich Web3 experience and determined to bring the best Web3 social application to users. Let's keep building!
